# **Nathan's D&D Character Creator**

This project currently only supports up to level 5 characters. This accounts for most of the unique features and sub classes that exist in the game, but to support up to level 20 characters would require a lot more data entry.

## Features

You can build faithful and accurate D&D characters for fifth edition. There is full implementation of proficiencies, sub classes, languages, and more. This includes an in-depth armor and weapons system, and support for special features like Ki points and unarmored defense.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production and deploys to github pages. link: https://nathan-zucker.github.io/dnd-5e-character-creator/ \
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`
